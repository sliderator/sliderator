#I step off the train I'm walking down
---
#your street again And past your door But
---
#you don't live there anymore It's
---
#years since you've been there Now
---
#you've disappeared somewhere Like
---
#outer space You've found some better
---
#place And I miss you Like the deserts
---
#miss the rain Could you be dead? You
---
#always were two steps ahead Of everyone We'd
---
#walk behind while you would run
